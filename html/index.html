            Golf, a cross-country game in which a player strikes a small ball
            with various clubs from a series of starting points (teeing grounds)
            into a series of holes on a course. The player who holes his ball in
            the fewest strokes wins Golf is a very popular sport worldwide. It
            is a game played on a large outdoor course, the object being to
            propel a small hard ball into a series of 'holes' with as few
            strokes as possible, using a variety of wood or iron-tipped sticks
            or 'golf clubs'here two basic forms of playing golf: Match play and
            Stroke play. In addition, many other formats for golf tournaments
            exist, some official game types such as Stableford, Bogey and Par
            Competitions, or as a team in a Foursome and Four ball game.The
            current Rules of Golf published and approved by the United States
            Golf Association and the R&A Rules Limited consists of over 200
            pages covering 34 rules in-depth. The first known written set of
            rules for golf consisted of 13 rules.Golf originated from a game
            played on the eastern coast of Scotland, in an area close to the
            royal capital of Edinburgh. In those early days players would
            attempt to hit a pebble over sand dunes and around tracks using a
            bent stick or club.While the modern game of golf originated in 15th
            century Scotland, the game's ancient origins are unclear and much
            debated. Some historians trace the sport back to the Roman game of
            paganica, in which participants used a bent stick to hit a stuffed
            leather ball.The word 'golf' is not an acronym for anything. Rather,
            it derives linguistically from the Dutch word 'kolf' or 'kolve,'
            meaning quite simply 'club. ' In the Scottish dialect of the late
            14th or early 15th century, the Dutch term became 'goff' or 'gouff,'
            and only later in the 16th century 'golf. '

                The Game, Player Conduct and the Rules
                <p>
                    Golf is played in a round of 18 (or fewer) holes on a course
                    by striking a ball with a club. Each hole starts with a
                    stroke from the teeing area and ends when the ball is holed
                    on the putting green (or when the Rules otherwise say the
                    hole is completed). For each stroke, the player: Plays the
                    course as they find it, and Plays the ball as it lies.

            <header>Conduct Expected of All Players</header>
            <p>
                All players are expected to play in the spirit of the game by:
                Acting with integrity – for example, by following the Rules,
                applying all penalties, and being honest in all aspects of play.
                Showing consideration to others – for example, by playing at a
                prompt pace, looking out for the safety of others, and not
                distracting the play of another player. If a player plays a ball
                in a direction where there might be a danger of hitting someone,
                they should immediately shout a warning, such as the traditional
                warning of “fore”. Taking good care of the course – for example,
                by replacing divots, smoothing bunkers, repairing ball-marks,
                and not causing unnecessary damage to the course. There is no
                penalty under the Rules for failing to act in this way, except
                that the Committee may disqualify a player for acting contrary
                to the spirit of the game if it finds that the player has
                committed serious misconduct. “Serious misconduct” is player
                behaviour that is so far removed from what is expected in golf
                that the most severe sanction of removing a player from the
                competition is justified. Penalties other than disqualification
                may be imposed for player misconduct only if those penalties are
                adopted as part of a Code of Conduct under
            </p>
